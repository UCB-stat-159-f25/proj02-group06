For Project 2, our group split up the work such that Char did Part 1, Ethan did Part 2, Param did Part 3, built the Myst website, added the Binder to the ReadMe, and did final repo clean-up, and Eden did Part 4, the AI documentation doc, and the contribution statement. We all maintained the repo structure for our portion of the project. Everyone worked really well together. We coordinated in the lab, communicated over text, and helped each other when we ran into issues.
