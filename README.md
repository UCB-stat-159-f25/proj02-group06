# STAT159/259 Fall 2025 Project 2 
## Reproducibility in Natural Language Processing
### Group 06

For this project, we used the dataset containing every State of the Union speech given by each president. Each part of the project utilized different natural language processing tools to analyze, visualize, and interpret the speeches’ contents.

Part one of the project involves initial exploration of the data including initial analysis of the number of speeches per president and per year and word count distributions across the years and across presidents. 

Part two of the project explores some simple text processing techniques involving analysis of tokens and lemmas for determining word frequency as well as exploring analysis with vectorization and TF-IDF embedding to delve further into word significance in pieces of text along with how rare or common an individual word may be amongst the overall content of the data set.

Part three of the project dives into deeper analysis using advanced text processing techniques such as LDA and BERTopic topic modeling to explore topics based on word occurrences and semantic similarities within the data. 

Part four of the project investigates the similarity of speeches using spaCy, which compares words and predicts how similar they are in meaning. Two different analyses were chosen: one finds the two presidents with the most similar speeches, and the other computes the similarity in speeches between the beginning and end of Trump’s first term.
